KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. BCI_IV_2b Performance (66.24%):
   - Strongest performance across all datasets
   - Good stability (±10.24% std)
   - 2-class problem is more tractable than 4-class

2. BCI_IV_2a Performance (44.87%):
   - Moderate overall performance
   - High variance across subjects (±15.33% std)
   - Suggests subject-specific patterns not fully captured
   - 4-class problem is more difficult

3. PhysioNet_MI Performance (35.86%):
   - Lowest performance despite stable variation
   - Very low overall accuracy
   - 64 channels but small sample size
   - Model may not be suitable for this multi-channel data

VISUALIZATIONS GENERATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Spatial Filters (Topomaps)
   - Shows learned spatial patterns across electrode positions
   - Generated from depthwise convolutional layer weights

2. Temporal Filters (Spectral Response)
   - Shows frequency sensitivity of learned temporal filters
   - Indicates which frequency bands (alpha, beta) are important

3. Class-Specific Figure 3
   - Per-class analysis of spatial and spectral importance
   - Shows what distinguishes each motor imagery class

4. t-SNE Visualizations
   - 2D projections of learned feature representations
   - Demonstrates how model separates classes in feature space

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The visualizations confirm that EEGNet learns neurophysiologically
plausible patterns:

- Spatial filters show concentration in sensorimotor cortex regions
- Temporal filters emphasize alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands
- These align with known motor imagery EEG signatures

However, low PhysioNet performance suggests architecture limitations
with high-channel, small-sample datasets.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Architecture: Consider deeper or wider networks
2. Subject-specific adaptation for BCI_IV_2a
3. Specialized architecture for high-channel data (PhysioNet)
4. Data augmentation tuning per dataset
5. Transfer learning from BCI_IV_2b to other datasets
